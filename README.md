# Analysis of the [Small-Body DataBase API](https://ssd-api.jpl.nasa.gov/doc/sbdb_query.html) using a Pandas framework on Python.

This program was created as a final project for a trimester-long Data Science class at Woodberry Forest School.    

**SBDBanalysis.ipynb** - main file of the program  
**bib.txt** - used sources  
In order to run the program, **.env** file must be created and contain the API key under the variable named *NASA_KEY*.    


This is the original prompt for the assignment:

# Python II: Data Science

## Final Project

This project is designed to test your ability to work with data and to use the tools and techniques that we have covered in the class. 

The project is divided into six parts:

1. **Data Sourcing**
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
3. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
4. **Data Analysis**
5. **Data Visualization**
6. **Conclusion**

You will be tasked with sourcing data using APIs, web scraping, or a combination of the two. You'll perform some exploratory data analysis to get a feel for the types and structure of the data you'll be working with. You will then need to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Once the data is ready, you will need to perform some analyses on the data and then create some visualizations to present your findings.

Given the individual nature of the project, you will be given a structure to follow, but the specifics of the project will be up to you. You will need to make decisions on what data to use, what analyses to perform, and how to present your findings.

You will have 2 weeks to complete the project. The project is due on **Thursday, February 29th at 11:00 PM**.

## Resources

You are encouraged to use any and **all** resources available to you. This includes any code we have written in class, blog posts you find online, documentation, generative AI (ChatGPT, Copilot, etc.), and any other resources you can find. Since this project is individual, you are allowed to discuss the nature of your code with your classmates, but you are not allowed to receive any direct help with your code. As always, please use the `bib.txt` file provided to cite any resources you use, including ChatGPT logs and brief descriptions of the conversations you may have had with classmates.

## Submission

Please submit your project as both a PDF and a Jupyter Notebook file to Canvas. Please also ensure that your GitHub repository is up to date.
